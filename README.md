# pass Culture Institutional

Welcome to the pass culture institutional project !

## Local Database
If you want to run the backend locally, you need to install Postgres on your machine. 
With commands (or PgAdmin) you must create a db with the following:
- Database name: db_institutional

## Project Scripts
Before you can use the scripts, ensure you have Yarn installed on your system.
The project includes several scripts to simplify development and setup:

- `frontend`: Start the development server for the frontend part of the application.

- `backend`: Start the development server for the backend part of the application.

- `clear`: Remove temporary files and caches in the frontend directory.

- `setup:frontend`: Install dependencies for the frontend part of the application.

- `setup:backend`: Install dependencies for the backend part of the application.

- `setup`: Install all project dependencies and set up both frontend and backend components.

- `dev`: This is the main script to run during development. It clears caches, and concurrently starts both the frontend and backend servers, allowing you to work on both parts of the application simultaneously.
