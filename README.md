# pass Culture Institutional

Welcome to the pass culture institutional project !

This repo contains two important folders `public_website` (Next) and `content_management_system` (Strapi) for the institutional site.

This README contains general information that concerns the both folders.

For more specific information:

## Start the project

Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies by running the following commands:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

> Don't forget to add to `/public_website` and `/content_management_system` the `.env` with the correct environment variables from pass Culture [1Password](https://team-passculture.1password.com/) (search "Site institutionnel" in "Tech" section).

## Local Database

If you want to run the content_management_system locally, you need to install Postgres on your machine. With commands (or PgAdmin) you must create a db with the following:

- Database name: db_institutional

More information on how to setup here: [content_management_system documentation](./content_management_system/README.md)

## Project Scripts

Before you can use the scripts, ensure you have `Yarn` installed on your system.
The project includes several scripts to simplify development and setup:

- `yarn public_website`: Start the public_website development server.
- `yarn content_management_system`: Start the content_management_system development server.
- `yarn clear`: Remove temporary files and caches in the public_website directory.
- `yarn setup:public_website`: Install the public_website dependencies.
- `yarn setup:content_management_system`: Install the content_management_system dependencies.
- `yarn setup`: Install the public_website and content_management_system project dependencies.
- `yarn dev`: Run during development. It clears caches, and starts the public_website and content_management_system servers.
- `yarn audit:all`: Test all the vulnerabilities packages.
- `yarn test:deadcode`: Test both public_website and content_management_system dead code.
- `yarn test:deadcode:update`: Update the public_website and content_management_system dead code snapshots.
- `yarn test:lint:` Test both public_website and content_management_system linting.
- `yarn test:types:` Test both public_website and content_management_system typing.

## Testing

### Public website

Unit tests should be created for components and functions.

When a component is created to be used in several places and when it contains logic, it is better to test it in its own file, and (when necessary) mock it in the files where it is called.

We also use snapshot testing, so when intended UI changes are made, be sure to update the snapshot.

### Content management system

No tests have been written yet. As of end of 2023, Strapi has not documented a satisfying way to implement unit testing. The [example provided in the Strapi documentation](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/testing) does not respect the principle of [immutable infrastructure](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-is-immutable-infrastructure).

The Strapi documentation recommends to use a temp local file to host a SQLite database for unit testing. We would be using a different database instance from the one used in production. This means that we could successfully pass our unit tests but the server could be down in production.

## PR title format ðŸ¤–

### Why

- To have consistent PR titles
- To have consistent commit messages on `main`

##### About squashing the PR commits

If we squash the PR when we merge it, the PR title becomes the commit message on `main`.
As a result, we just need to enforce consistency on the title of the PR to have consistent commit message on `main`.

The commits of the PR won't be on `main`, but are still useful for PR readiness and for future reference.

### Key points

- The agreed upon format for the PR title is:

```
<jira> <type>(<scope>): <short summary>
  â”‚       â”‚      |             â”‚
  â”‚       â”‚      |             â””â”€â«¸ PR Summary: short summary of the Jira ticket title in English. Present tense.
  â”‚       â”‚      |                  Not capitalized. No period at the end.
  â”‚       â”‚      |
  â”‚       â”‚      â””â”€â«¸ PR Scope: Hierarchical scope. Not capitalized, but snakeCase. For instance:
  â”‚       â”‚           app, core, themeProvider... > identityCheck, eac, booking, search... > useSelectHomepageEntry...
  â”‚       â”‚
  â”‚       â””â”€â«¸ PR Type: build, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor or test.
  |            See https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#type
  â”‚
  â””â”€â«¸ Jira ticket number: with parentheses -> PC-1234.
