# pass Culture Institutional

Welcome to the pass culture institutional project !

This repo contains two important folders `public_website` (Next) and `content_management_system` (Strapi) for the institutional site.

This README contains general information that concerns the both folders.

For more specific information:

## Requirements

1. Ensure you have [Node.js 20.8.0](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system. If you are using `NVM` you can simply use the command `nvm install` if you don't have 20.8.0 previously installed or `nvm use` if you do.
2. You should have `Yarn` installed: `corepack enable`

## Start the project

From the root of the project, you can install the dependencies for the `public_website` and the `content_management_system` with the following commands:

```bash
yarn setup
yarn dev
```

> Don't forget to add to `/public_website` and `/content_management_system` the `.env` with the correct environment variables. You can find instructions for [the .env of the public_website](./public_website/README.md#configure-environment-variables) and [for the .env of the content_management_system](./content_management_system/README.md#configure-environment-variables).

## Local Database

If you want to run the content_management_system locally, you need to install Postgres on your machine. With commands (or PgAdmin) you must create a db with the following:

- Database name: db_institutional

More information on how to setup here: [content_management_system documentation](./content_management_system/README.md)

## Project Scripts

Before you can use the scripts, ensure you have `Yarn` installed on your system.
The project includes several scripts to simplify development and setup:

- `yarn public_website`: Start the public_website development server.
- `yarn content_management_system`: Start the content_management_system development server.
- `yarn clear`: Remove temporary files and caches in the public_website directory.
- `yarn setup:public_website`: Install the public_website dependencies.
- `yarn setup:content_management_system`: Install the content_management_system dependencies.
- `yarn setup`: Install the public_website and content_management_system project dependencies.
- `yarn dev`: Run during development. It clears caches, and starts the public_website and content_management_system servers.
- `yarn audit:all`: Test all the vulnerabilities packages.
- `yarn test:deadcode`: Test both public_website and content_management_system dead code.
- `yarn test:deadcode:update`: Update the public_website and content_management_system dead code snapshots.
- `yarn test:lint`: Test both public_website and content_management_system linting.
- `yarn test:types`: Test both public_website and content_management_system typing.

## Testing

### Public website

Unit tests should be created for components and functions.

When a component is created to be used in several places and when it contains logic, it is better to test it in its own file, and (when necessary) mock it in the files where it is called.

We also use snapshot testing, so when intended UI changes are made, be sure to update the snapshot.

### Content management system

No tests have been written yet. As of end of 2023, Strapi has not documented a satisfying way to implement unit testing. The [example provided in the Strapi documentation](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/testing) does not respect the principle of [immutable infrastructure](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-is-immutable-infrastructure).

The Strapi documentation recommends to use a temp local file to host a SQLite database for unit testing. We would be using a different database instance from the one used in production. This means that we could successfully pass our unit tests but the server could be down in production.

## PR title format ðŸ¤–

### Why

- To have consistent PR titles
- To have consistent commit messages on `main`

##### About squashing the PR commits

If we squash the PR when we merge it, the PR title becomes the commit message on `main`.
As a result, we just need to enforce consistency on the title of the PR to have consistent commit message on `main`.

The commits of the PR won't be on `main`, but are still useful for PR readiness and for future reference.

### Key points

- We are simply following this [convention](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification)

Here is a recap:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
  â”‚          â”‚               â”‚
  â”‚          â”‚               â””â”€â«¸ PR Description: A short and concise summary of the changes. Present tense.
  â”‚          â”‚                    Not capitalized.
  â”‚          â”‚
  â”‚          â””â”€â«¸ PR Scope: A scope MUST consist of a noun describing a section of the codebase surrounded by parenthesis, e.g., fix(parser)
  |
  â”‚
  â””â”€â«¸ PR Type: build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, feat:, fix:, perf:, refactor:, revert:, style:, test:
```

Here is a more detailed explanation for different types:

build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
chore: Changes that are routine tasks, maintenance work, or other non-functional activities that don't directly impact the user-facing features or bug fixes.
ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
docs: Documentation only changes
feat: A new feature
fix: A bug fix
perf: A code change that improves performance
refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
revert: indicate that the changes are reverting a previous commit/PR
style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
