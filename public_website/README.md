# pass Culture Institutional public website

## Configure environment variables

You will find a template for the environnement variables under `public_website/.env.example`. Duplicate and rename the file `.env`. For running in a local development environnement, you should set `STRAPI_API_URL` to the port Strapi is running on, for example: `http://localhost:1337`.

At the moment, it is not possible to create a build for the website with a non-local instance of the Content Management System. To build locally you must have the CMS running on your own machine.

If you set `STRAPI_API_URL` to a non-local instance of the CMS (for example the testing version: `https://siteinstit-cms.testing.passculture.team`), the token the Public Website needs to access the CMS (Google IAP protected) that is usually provided by the CI will not be found by Next.

> Usually, to access environment variables in the browser, they have to be prefixed by `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. In our case, we only need `STRAPI_API_URL` to be available in the Node.js environment.

There are also 2 environment variables that are used to build the playlists. Since `INSTITUTIONAL_API_KEY` is only available in our CI for security reasons. In consequence, it is not possible locally to get the playlists from our backend. We have included dummy playlist data directly in Next for local development.

## Start the Public Website

Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies by running the following commands:

```bash
cd public_website
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## Test files location

By default, Next.js will take into account any file ending with tsx, ts, jsx or js under the pages folder for the purpose of building pages/API routes and routing.

We follow Jest's convention by adding tests to the **tests** folder in the project's root directory.
It is not possible to have the test files along side the page files or the build will fail.

## Project Scripts

Before you can use the scripts, ensure you have `Yarn` installed on your system.
The project includes several scripts to simplify development and setup:

- `yarn build`: Build the application for production.
- `yarn dev`: Start the Next.js development server.
- `yarn start`: Start the application in production mode.
- `yarn test`: Run tests using Vitest.
- `yarn test:deadcode`: Find unused code using ts-prune.
- `yarn test:lint`: Run the linter to check code quality.
- `yarn test:types`: Check typing.
